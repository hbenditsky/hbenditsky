- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with this Swift code. It creates a countdown timer which is displayed on my iPhone. I need help with getting the timer to play an mp3 file (which is included) when the timer gets to the midpoint of its run time and then again when the timer runs down to 0. The code I've written runs fine but no sound is played either at the mid point or at the end. Please suggest changes that would correct this problem. Thank you
